Add this to your Vercel project settings:

**Variable Name**: `VITE_API_URL`  
**Value**: Your backend URL (e.g., `https://your-backend.railway.app` or `http://localhost:8000` for testing)

## How to Add in Vercel Dashboard

1. Go to your project in Vercel
2. Settings → Environment Variables
3. Add:
   - **Key**: `VITE_API_URL`
   - **Value**: `https://your-backend-url.com` (without trailing slash)
   - **Environment**: Production, Preview, Development (select all)
4. Redeploy for changes to take effect

This will be used during local development with `npm run dev`.
