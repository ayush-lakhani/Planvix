        Analyze this SPECIFIC business and create THREE ultra-detailed buyer personas covering different segments:

        - Experience Level: {strategy_input.experience}
        
        🚨 CRITICAL VALIDATION RULES 🚨
        1. Generate 3 DISTINCT personas - NOT the same persona 3 times
        2. Each persona MUST have DIFFERENT age ranges (e.g., 18-24, 25-34, 35-45)
        3. NO GENERIC "Working Professional" or "25-34" defaults unless highly specific to the industry
        4. Each persona MUST mention the actual industry ({strategy_input.industry}) in pain_points or desires
        5. If you output generic personas, the task FAILS - regenerate with specific details!

        **CRITICAL: IMAGE PROMPT ENGINEERING RULES**
        You are a SENIOR PROMPT ENGINEER. Create image prompts that would generate stunning, viral-worthy visuals.
        
        Each image_prompt MUST include:
        1. **Main Subject**: What's the focal point? (person, product, scene)
        2. **Setting/Environment**: Where is this happening? Be specific
        3. **Lighting**: Natural light, golden hour, studio lighting, neon, etc.
        4. **Mood/Atmosphere**: Emotional tone (inspiring, cozy, energetic, professional)
        5. **Color Palette**: Specific colors or color schemes (warm tones, vibrant, pastel, monochrome)
        6. **Composition**: Angle and framing (overhead flat lay, close-up, wide shot, rule of thirds)
        7. **Style**: Photography style (commercial, cinematic, minimalist, editorial, lifestyle)
        8. **Technical Details**: Camera details if relevant (shallow depth of field, bokeh, sharp focus)
        9. **Platform-Specific Elements**: Props or elements that work for {strategy_input.platform}
        10. **Trending Aesthetics**: Current visual trends in {strategy_input.industry}
        
        EXAMPLE OF BAD IMAGE PROMPT (too vague):
        "Professional workspace with laptop showing dashboard, vibrant colors"
        
        EXAMPLE OF EXCELLENT IMAGE PROMPT (detailed, specific):
        "Aesthetic flat lay on marble desk, MacBook Pro displaying Instagram analytics with rising engagement graph, scattered coffee beans around steaming latte with heart latte art, iPhone showing trending Reel with play button, warm golden hour sunlight streaming from left creating soft shadows, cozy morning productivity vibe, color palette: cream whites, warm browns, gold accents, shot from directly overhead at 90 degrees, shallow depth of field with coffee cup in sharp focus and background softly blurred, minimalist lifestyle photography style, includes small succulent plant and gold pen for visual interest, optimized for Instagram feed aesthetic"
        
        Make EVERY image prompt this detailed and specific! Think like a professional content creator hiring a photographer.
        
        Output a JSON object with:
        {{
            "calendar": [... 12 calendar items optimized for {strategy_input.contentType} ...],
            "sample_posts": [... 3 sample posts with DETAILED image prompts ...]
        }}
        
        Base everything on:
        - Goal: {strategy_input.goal}
        - Platform: {strategy_input.platform}
        - Industry: {strategy_input.industry}
        - Content Type: {strategy_input.contentType} (CRITICAL!)
        - Audience insights from previous agents
        - Competitor gaps from previous agents
        - Strategic guidance from previous agents
        - Keywords from previous agents
        
        Make every post strategically aligned with the goal, visually stunning, and optimized for {strategy_input.contentType}!
